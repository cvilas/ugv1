Tasklist for UGV1

Objective: Teleoperation within the local wireless network

- purchases: 
    - USB to Serial that works on Samsung Galaxy2
    - Mounting box for Uno
    - RS232 adapter
    - Joystick for android device

- Grape libs
    - Config
    - Stopwatch and timestamping
    - Status (fixed size circular buffer to a message and code)

- IoBoard
    - timestamp message arrival time
	
- IoBoardModel
    - Confirm encoder count is accurate
    - Confifrm motor speed responses are accurate

- RobotController
    - Implement timed loop
    - Implement software safety interlocks - bumper sensors, proximity sensors
    - Implement HMI Server
        - TCP or UDP (user selectable)
        - Accepts DesiredState from HMI, replies with CurrentState
        - Resets DesiredState motor power after timeout with HMI and stops processing further inputs
    - Deploy controller on Android 

- Replace all individual Status objects with one error logging mechanism

- HMI
    - Desktop based HMI
    - Android HMI (phone, tablet)
    - Arduino HMI
    - Joystick-to-drive signal adapter
    - Trial Google Hangout for audio-visual comms

- Issues
    - Encoder does not reset to 0 on reset command
    - Encoder does not change when wheel back-driven

- Hangout API mods
    - Customise Hangout to transport control and status messages

- Ligting pack
    - Blue undercarriage lights
    - White LED head lamp
    - Blinking direction indicator LEDs

- Battery voltage monitor circuit

- Horn/multitone alarm

- Racer stripes
	
- Mechanical
    - Mount joystick securely in a box
