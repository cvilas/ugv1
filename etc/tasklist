Tasklist for UGV1

Objective: Teleoperation within the local wireless network

- purchases: 
	- USB to Serial that works on Samsung Galaxy2
	- Mounting box for Uno
        - RS232 adapter
        - Joystick for android device

- Grape libs
    - SerialPort for windows
    - Config
    - Stopwatch and timestamping
    - Status (fixed size circular buffer to a message and code)

- IoBoard
    - timestamp message arrival time

- RobotController
    - Configuration data structure (fixed size)
        - servo pins
        - digital out pins
        - drive train parameters - encoder ppr, gear ratio, wheel perimeter
        - PID gains
        - motor control mode
    - DesiredState data structure (fixed size)
        - Digital outputs
        - Servo outputs
        - Motor speed
    - CurrentState data structure (fixed size)
        - Digital inputs + timestamp
        - Analog inputs + timestamp
        - Speed + timestamp
        - current + timestamp
        - encoder + timestamp
    - Encoder reset on motor direction reversal (speed and encoder values are signed long long in CurrentState)
    - Loops continuously updating state
    - Implements software safety loops - bumper sensors, proximity sensors
    - Server
        - TCP or UDP (user selectable)
        - Accepts DesiredState from HMI, replies with CurrentState
        - Resets DesiredState motor power after timeout with HMI and stops processing further inputs
    - Android hosted controller
    - Customised Google hangout (or similar) API
    - HMI
        - Desktop based HMI
        - Android HMI (phone, tablet)
        - Arduino HMI
        - Joystick-to-drive signal adapter
        - Customised Google hangout (or similar) API
- Issues
    - Encoder does not reset to 0 on reset command
    - Encoder does not change when wheel back-driven

- Mechanical
    - Mount joystick securely in a box
