Objective: Teleoperation within the local wireless network

- purchases: 
    - USB to Serial that works on Samsung Galaxy2
    - Mounting box for Uno

- General
    - Remove all explicit exception specifiers (throw() statement in function prototype). Document what is thrown instead
    - For every function, document what may be thrown briefly (eg: Throws PortException)

- IoBoard
    - timestamp message arrival time
	
- IoBoardModel
    - Confirm encoder count is accurate
    - Confirm motor speed responses are accurate

- RobotController
    - Tune PID control
    - Mode selection control
    - Battery monitor
    - Health messages
    - Sensor messages
    - publish command messages
    - optimise host for UDP multicast - http://lcm.googlecode.com/svn/www/reference/lcm/multicast.html
    - Document the UDP multicast optimisation procedure in the Agent docs

- JoystickController
    - Spline function to map axes inputs for smooth start about zero

- HMI
    - Desktop based HMI
