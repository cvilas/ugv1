    (2) Robot controller running Android
    (3) Remote controller on laptop running windows or linux

Development tasks
=================

Hardware
--------

- Undercarriage RGB mood light (show battery power status, health)
- DFRobot URM04 ultrasonic sensors x 6
- Battery voltage monitor circuit (10-16V range)
- Racer stripes
- Pan/tilt camera head

Software
--------
- IoBoard
    - timestamp message arrival time, especially for odometry messages

- IoBoardModel
    - Confirm encoder count is accurate
    - Do not reset encoder count when motor changes direction. Just count down.
    - Experimentally verify motor speed responses are accurate

- Fix issues
    - Encoder does not reset to 0 on reset command
    - Encoder does not change when wheel back-driven

- JoystickController
    - Spline function to map axes inputs for smooth start about zero
    - Support for DFRbobot WiFi joystick

- Robot controller
    - Derive AgentMessenger from AgentThread
    - Tune PID control
    - Mode selection control
    - Battery monitor
    - Health messages (battery,)
    - Sensor messages (bumper,motor currents)
    - publish command messages
    - optimise host for UDP multicast - http://lcm.googlecode.com/svn/www/reference/lcm/multicast.html
    - Document the UDP multicast optimisation procedure in the Agent docs

- Decision point: Android or separate computer board for onboard control

- Camera controller agent
    - Connect and initialise external webcam
    - publish compressed streaming video

- Camera viewer agent
    - Display streaming video


- Onboard controller agent app
    - Controller configuration page
    - subscribe to health messages and display stats (battery level, etc)
    - subscribe to sensor messages and display state (sensor activation, etc)
    - who is in control (remote console IP and name)

- HMI
    - Desktop based HMI
    - display health messages
    - display sensor messages
    - who am i (negotiate remote controller connection)

- General
    - Remove all explicit exception specifiers (throw() statement in function prototype). Document what is thrown instead
    - For every function, document what may be thrown briefly (eg: Throws PortException)

- Webpage
	- Videos, pictures, source code
