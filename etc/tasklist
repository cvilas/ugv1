Tasklist for UGV1 MakerFaire demo

Objective: Teleoperation within the local wireless network

- purchases: 
	- USB to Serial that works on Samsung Galaxy2
	- Mounting box for Uno
- Grape/IPort interface class
- Grape/SerialPort class 
- IoBoard driver interface class
- IoMessage adapters (command builder and reply interpreter)
- IoMessageServer class (serial/tcp port server to send/reply IoMessage objects)
- IoDriver node
	- receives commands from clients such as joysticks
	- sends commands to IO board
	- receives responses from IO board, responds to clients
	- reads sensors continuously - updates local copy with timestamp
	- software safety loops
	- IoDriver is the only node all user clients interact with
	- Configuration display (IP address, etc)
	- Lean GUI for system status
- Measure drive (motor/gear/encoder) mechanical parameters
- Wire up bumper switches (buy extender cables)
- JoystickNode (server)
- Joystick client
- Josytick simulator
- Deploy on tablet and test mobile system

- Controller phone interface
	- detect joystick
	- connect to robot, or configure joystick wifi to connect to robot directly
	- GCS HMI for command and control
- Arduino joystick
	- Serial interface to android phone
	- configuration via serial (IP of robot)
- Mount joystick securely in a box
- Test with wireless network
- Google+ hangout test between controller phone and robot
- Tests, tests, tests
