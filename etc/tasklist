Tasklist for UGV1

Objective: Teleoperation within the local wireless network

- purchases: 
	- USB to Serial that works on Samsung Galaxy2
	- Mounting box for Uno
        - RS232 adapter
        - Joystick for android device

- Grape libs
    - Config
    - Stopwatch and timestamping
    - Status (fixed size circular buffer to a message and code)

- IoBoard
    - timestamp message arrival time
	
- IoBoardModel
	- Means to deal with invalid response packets
	- Status object to hold error messages
	- In read, write and config functions, don't exit after first error. Try to apply as many 
	settings as possible
	- Confirm encoder count is accurate
	- Confifrm motor speed responses are accurate

- RobotController
	- Implement timed loop
    - Implements software safety interlocks - bumper sensors, proximity sensors
    - Implement HMI Server
        - TCP or UDP (user selectable)
        - Accepts DesiredState from HMI, replies with CurrentState
        - Resets DesiredState motor power after timeout with HMI and stops processing further inputs
    - Deploy controller on Android 

- HMI
        - Desktop based HMI
        - Android HMI (phone, tablet)
        - Arduino HMI
        - Joystick-to-drive signal adapter
		- Trial Google Hangout for audio-visual comms

- Issues
    - Encoder does not reset to 0 on reset command
    - Encoder does not change when wheel back-driven

- Hangout API mods
	- Customise Hangout to transport control and status messages

- Ligting pack
	- Blue undercarriage lights
	- White LED head lamp
	- Blinking direction indicator LEDs

- Battery voltage monitor circuit

- Racer stripes
	
- Mechanical
    - Mount joystick securely in a box
